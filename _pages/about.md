I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My research interests include network science, model reduction methodology, and multiscale modeling. My recent and ongoing projects include:
<ul> 
  <li> developing opinion dynamics models on temporal networks induced by interevent time distributions; </li>
  <li> using inverse problem techniques to infer parameters in continuous-valued opinion models from discrete decision observations; </li>
  <li> constructing reduced-order models for problems in quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics; </li>
</ul>
  
I was a PIC Assistant Adjunct Professor at UCLA, mentored by Prof. [Mason Porter](http://math.ucla.edu/~mason) and Prof. [Andrea Bertozzi](http://math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi). I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics at Penn State University under the supervision of Prof. [Xiantao Li](http://www.personal.psu.edu/xxl12/). Prior to that, I was an undergraduate student at Peking University, China.
