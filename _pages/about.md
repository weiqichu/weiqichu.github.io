I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My research interests include scientific computing, network science, and data science. You can find more about my past and ongoing projects [here](https://weiqichu.github.io/research/). 
  
I was a PIC Assistant Adjunct Professor at UCLA, mentored by Prof. [Mason Porter](http://math.ucla.edu/~mason) and Prof. [Andrea Bertozzi](http://math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi). I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics at Penn State University under the supervision of Prof. [Xiantao Li](http://www.personal.psu.edu/xxl12/). Prior to that, I was an undergraduate student at Peking University, China. 

I am co-organizing [the Applied Mathematics and Computation Seminar](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/seminars/applied-analysis-and-computation-seminar) and [the Mathematics of Machine Learning Seminar](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/seminars/reading-seminar-on-mathematics-of-machine-learning). Feel free to reach out if you'd like to give a talk.

[Opening] I am looking for Ph.D., Masterâ€™s, and undergraduate students to work on scientific computing, network science, and data science. Students are welcome to contact me with a CV (and/or transcripts, sample publications) attached if you are interested.
