My research interests include model reduction, network science, inference from data, and scientific computing. 

Model-reduction methods and multiscale modeling
-- 
One of my longstanding interests is to develop scalable and systematic approaches to reduce the dimensionality of complex models. 
My works in this theme can be devided into three categories: 
* Mori–Zwanzig theory
* Petro–Galerkin projection
* Lubrication theory

Dynamics on networks
--
My works stand at the intersection of networks and dynamics. I like to develop and include modeling and analysis of opinion dynamics on hypergraphs [1] and temporal graphs [2] with the aim to bridge agent-based (microscopic) and density-based (macroscopic) descriptions.
* A density-based opinion model on hypergraphs
* Non-Markovian opinion dynamics on temporal graphs
* Mean-field approximation of density-based opinion models

Inference from data
--
The parameters of many models play an essential role in shaping the behaviors of dynamics. Instead of choosing
them based on empirical methods, I approach the problem from an “inverse” perspective and seek methods that identify the intrinsic properties of the system from data. My works include
providing theoretical guarantees to ensure the identifiability of kernel functions and reconstructing the kernels numerically from partial observations in the context of both the mean-field
description and the agent-based models (ongoing work). 
* Inference of interaction kernels of a mean-field opinion model
